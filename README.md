# Nata Sans

**Nata Sans** is a grotesque typeface with a subtle humanist structure.

Originally designed for user interfaces, it features a generous x-height that gives it a slightly *display* feel. Its wide glyphs promote relaxed, slow, and clear reading — ideal for interfaces, editorial design, or signage.

With short ascenders and descenders, Nata Sans offers a compact yet balanced texture on the page. The distinctive curvature of letters like “o” and “a” forms the core of its visual identity.
