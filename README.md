# About Nata Sans
**Nata Sans is a grotesque typeface with a subtle humanistic structure.**

Designed for interfaces, with a generous x-height that adds a slight ***display*** look and feel.
Nata Sans is a typeface with wide glyphs that contribute to generating a more relaxed, slow and clear reading.

With short ascenders and descenders, this typeface exudes a restrained personality, ideal as a substitute for the Helvetica typeface.
The curvatures of the letters "o" and "a" contain the compositional principle that gives the font family a distinctive DNA.

The font family is 100% Latin Plus, covering 219 latin based languages, which are spoken in different 212 countries.
It is a variable font with six predefined weights ranging from thin to black.
The font contains 702 glyphs. Each glyph has three dedicated drawing to ensure a perfect interpolation between all four weights.
